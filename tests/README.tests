# Tests

We are faking answers coming from various API (authentication, ibmcloud, etc ..) with 
files based responses or custom content.

In order to have the tests working properly, launch the global tests like this:

```
[user@localhost ibmcloud-python-sdk]$ nosetests tests --rednose --verbose
```
or if you want to test a spefic module :

```
[user@localhost ibmcloud-python-sdk]$ nosetests tests/tests_vpc.py --rednose --verbose
```

if not, you can have issues due to the relative path of the answer file based on.
